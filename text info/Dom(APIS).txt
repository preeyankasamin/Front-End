DOM APIs (Document Object Model Application Programming Interfaces). 
The term "DOM APIs" encompasses all the methods and properties provided by the DOM for interacting
 with the HTML document, including:

- DOM Traversal Methods: Methods like 
`getElementById`,
 `getElementsByClassName`, 
 `getElementsByTagName`, 
 `querySelector`,
 `querySelectorAll`... that allow you to select and traverse through elements in the document.

- DOM Manipulation Methods: Methods like 
`createElement`,
`appendChild`,
`removeChild`, 
`replaceChild`,
`setAttribute`, 
`removeAttribute`, and others that allow you to modify the structure, content, and attributes 
of elements in the document.

So, it's perfectly accurate to call them DOM APIs as they are part of the interfaces 
provided by the DOM to interact with the web document.

DOM API'S or DOM Selector it's best to choose the term based on the context in which you are speaking or writing:

1. DOM Selector Methods: Use this term when you want to emphasize that these methods are specifically
 for selecting elements within the DOM. This is useful in contexts where you are explaining how to find 
 or access elements in the document.

2. DOM APIs: Use this term when you are discussing the broader set of functionalities provided by the DOM, 
which includes not just selection methods but also methods for creating, modifying, and deleting elements,
 handling events, and more.

In summary, if you are specifically talking about methods like
`getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, etc., DOM selector methods or DOM selection methods might be more precise.
If you are discussing the broader capabilities of interacting with the DOM, then DOM APIs is appropriate.
------------------------------------------
The methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`,
and similar are collectively referred to as DOM selection methods.
These methods are part of the DOM API and are used to select and manipulate elements within the HTML document. 

Here's a brief overview of some of these methods:

- `document.getElementById(id)`: Selects a single element by its `id`.
- `document.getElementsByClassName(className)`: Selects all elements with the specified class name.
- `document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)`: Selects all elements with the specified tag name.
- `document.querySelector(selector)`: Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
- `document.querySelectorAll(selector)`: Selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.

These methods are essential for interacting with and manipulating the DOM in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, a DOM (Document Object Model) selector is used to select and manipulate HTML elements.
 Here are some precise definitions for different types of DOM selectors:

1. `getElementById`:
   - Definition: Selects a single HTML element by its unique `id` attribute.
   - Example: `document.getElementById('myElement')`

2. `getElementsByClassName`:
   - Definition: Selects all HTML elements with a specific class name.
   - Example: `document.getElementsByClassName('myClass')`

3. `getElementsByTagName`:
   - Definition: Selects all HTML elements with a specific tag name.
   - Example: `document.getElementsByTagName('div')`

4. `querySelector`:
   - Definition: Selects the first HTML element that matches a specified CSS selector.
   - Example: `document.querySelector('.myClass')`

5. `querySelectorAll`:
   - Definition: Selects all HTML elements that match a specified CSS selector.
   - Example: `document.querySelectorAll('.myClass')`
